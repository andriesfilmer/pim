- Multiple days don't show correct in fullcalendar.
  For example 2015-01-22T10:00:00Z to 2015-01-23T20:00:00Z shows as one day!?

- We don't want to show the delete icon when creating a event.
  But the $scope.showDeleteBt don't work because of a conflict
  with the directive 'confirmation-needed'.
